Known issues:

iOS
- AdWhirl house ads icon displays at 1/2 size on retina devices
- AdWhirl house ads crash when tapped (missing AdWhirlWebBrowser NIB)
- Ads do not rotate when Marmalade's surface rotates (Marmalade seems to do its own rotation instead of using UIViewController's shouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientation:, see http://www.madewithmarmalade.com/devnet/forum/6734)
- Only built with AdMob, iAd, and AdWhirl house ads (will build with additional networks in next version)

Android
- Only built with AdMob and AdWhirl house ads (will build with additional networks in next version)
- s3eAdWhirlRequestFreshAd() unimplemented (AdWhirl's Android SDK doesn't seem to support manually requesting fresh ads)
- s3dAdWhirlRegister callbacks are not called (AdWhirl's Android SDK doesn't seem to support these notifications)
